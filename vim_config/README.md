This README explains how to configure Vim by creating a `.vimrc` file in your home directory. The `.vimrc` file allows you to customize the behavior of Vim according to your preferences.

## Steps to Create and Configure `.vimrc`

1. **Create the `.vimrc` file**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to create the `.vimrc` file in your home directory:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.vimrc
   ```

2. **Open the `.vimrc` file in Vim**:
   After creating the file, you can open it for editing by running:
   ```bash
   vim ~/.vimrc
   ```

3. **Paste the configuration**:
   Copy the desired configuration settings and paste them into the `.vimrc` file.

4. **Save and close the file**:
   In Vim’s command mode, type the following to save and exit:
   ```
   :wq
   ```
