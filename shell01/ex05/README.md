# Command Explanation: `#!/bin/bash`, `git log --format="%H" -n 5 | cat -e`

This README explains the usage of the shell script and git command `git log --format="%H" -n 5 | cat -e`.

## Command Breakdown

This script retrieves the IDs of the last 5 commits from the current Git repository and appends a `$` at the end of each line for formatting.

### 1. `#!/bin/bash`

The line `#!/bin/bash` is called a **shebang**. It indicates that the script should be run using the `bash` shell. This ensures that the script executes in a Bash environment.

### 2. `git log --format="%H" -n 5`

The `git log` command shows the commit history of a Git repository.

- **`--format="%H"`**: Displays only the commit hashes. `%H` is the placeholder for the full commit hash.
- **`-n 5`**: Limits the output to the last 5 commits. This will give us the 5 most recent commit hashes.

### 3. `| cat -e`

The `|` symbol is a pipe, which takes the output of the `git log` command and passes it to the next command (`cat -e`).

- **`cat -e`**: This command displays each line of input and appends a `$` at the end of each line. This is useful for showing line breaks clearly, especially when required to format the output in a specific way (as in this case, adding `$` to the end of each commit hash).

### Example:

If you have the following recent commits:

```
commit 1a2b3c4d
commit 5e6f7g8h
commit 9i0j1k2l
```

Running this script will output:
```
1a2b3c4d$
5e6f7g8h$
9i0j1k2l$
```

### Usage:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x git_commit.sh
   ```

2. Run the script to get the last 5 commit IDs with `$` appended:
   ```bash
   ./git_commit.sh
   ```
