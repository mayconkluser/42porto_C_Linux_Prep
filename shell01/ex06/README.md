# Command Explanation: `#!/bin/bash`, `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard | cat -e`

This README explains the usage of the shell script and Git command `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard | cat -e`.

## Command Breakdown

This script lists all the local files that are ignored by the Git repository and appends a `$` at the end of each line for formatting.

### 1. `#!/bin/bash`

The line `#!/bin/bash` is called a **shebang**. It indicates that the script should be run using the `bash` shell. This ensures that the script executes in a Bash environment.

### 2. `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard`

The `git ls-files` command is used to show information about files in a Git repository.

- **`--others`**: Lists files that are not being tracked by Git.
- **`--ignored`**: Includes files that are ignored by Git, according to the `.gitignore` file.
- **`--exclude-standard`**: Ensures that Git respects the standard ignore files such as `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude`.

Together, these options list files that are ignored by Git and not tracked by the repository.

### 3. `| cat -e`

The `|` symbol is a pipe, which takes the output of the `git ls-files` command and passes it to the next command (`cat -e`).

- **`cat -e`**: This command displays each line of input and appends a `$` at the end of each line. This is useful for showing line breaks clearly, especially when required to format the output in a specific way (as in this case, adding `$` to the end of each ignored file name).

### Example:

If you have the following ignored files in your Git repository:

```
.DS_Store
mywork.c~
```

Running this script will output:
```
.DS_Store$
mywork.c~$
```

### Usage:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x git_ignore.sh
   ```

2. Run the script to get a list of ignored files with `$` appended:
   ```bash
   ./git_ignore.sh
   ```
